# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 05-06-2025

This Privacy Policy describes how VibeGames and its parent company, Analytic Intelligence Solutions ("we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the VibeGames demonstration.

## Information Collection

The VibeGames demo uses local browser storage to store:

- User profile information
- Game data and preferences
- Game creation content
- Usage statistics

## Data Storage and Transmission
All information is stored entirely on your device or within your personal, shareable file copy using our proprietary DataSpace technology. No data is transmitted to our servers. The VibeGames platform operates without requiring external server connections for its core functionality.

## Data Sharing
When you choose to share content with others, a copy of the VibeGames file with your selected data attached is created. You control exactly what information is shared and with whom.

## Security
VibeGames implements multiple security measures:

- Game execution occurs in isolated sandbox environments
- DataSpace technology automatically neutralizes potentially malicious code
- No server connections means no vulnerability to typical server-side attacks

## Analytics and Tracking
The VibeGames demonstration does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or analytics tools that send data to third parties.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will always be available within the application.
