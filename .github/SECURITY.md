## Patent Protection
The underlying technology that powers the VibeGames software, DataSpace, is the subject of provisional patent application [APPLICATION NUMBER] filed with [PATENT OFFICE] on [FILING DATE]. Unauthorized use, reproduction, or modification of this technology may constitute patent infringement and may result in legal action.

## Security Framework
VibeGames employs multiple security layers to protect user data and system integrity:

1. Sandboxed Execution Environment: All game code executes in isolated environments to prevent unauthorized system access.
2. Client-Side Security: Our proprietary DataSpace technology implements client-side validation techniques that protect against common attack vectors.
3. Serverless Architecture: By eliminating server dependencies, we eliminate many traditional attack surfaces.
4. Access Controls: User-defined permissions control what data is accessible and shareable.

## Data Security
All user data remains on the local device and is never transmitted to external servers without explicit user action. When sharing is initiated by a user, only the specific data selected for sharing is included in the shareable file.
